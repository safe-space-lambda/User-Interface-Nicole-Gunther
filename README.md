**MVP:** User can log in and set up a variety of reminders as to why they, themeselves, recognize what makes them great. Users can create a profile, and add messages to their profile. Can Create, Read, Update and delete message data. Once your messages to yourself are complete, you'll submit them to be sent to you via Text messsage throughout the day. Use Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/) to set up the messaging services necessary for your app to send out the reminders.
