                            <p class="review-extended hidden">"As a mom, I spend a lot of timing loving and caring for others. Sometimes there isn't
                                enough time in the day to do anything for myself. Safe Space allows me to give myself a pat on the back for my hard
                                work, and I don't need to spend much time doing it! And the best part is, it's free! Definitely give this a try if
                                you're feeling overwhelmed or want that motivational push."</p>

                                losing clients. I tend to be pretty hard on myself, but then a friend told me about Safe Space. It's been great
                                to get that reminder that I'm an awesome person, especially because it's coming from my toughest critic: me!
                                Plus, my clients have been really happy with my photos since I stopped beating myself up and remained focused."</p>

                            <p class="review-extended hidden">"I've been using Safe Space for a few weeks now, and it has helped me remember that,
                                as much as I want to make others happy, my own happiness is still extremely important. It does feel a little strange
                                at first, writing messages to yourself. But once you get used to it, it's amazing. Others may come and go, but you
                                will always have yourself. So why should your happiness depend on anyone else?"</p>
